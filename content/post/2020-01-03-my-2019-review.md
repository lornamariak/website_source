*You don‚Äôt get to the learning without the failure.* ~Beth Comstock<br>

If you're reading this from [lornamariak.com](https://www.lornamariak.com/), pause for a second...I still cannot believe I did that. 2019 tried me and here is what I learned.
<hr>
#### PAIN üò©
For the longest time in my life, I always came off as a happy person who has their life together and built in me a complex of having to be strong no matter what. As if that is not bad, I have held this stupid idea that openly expressing my emotions is a sign of weakness. All this has denied me an outlet, I am constantly looking for ways to replace what I feel with what makes me forget everything but the complexity of human emotions came at me this year.<br>
A life long relationship was crumbling and all I could do was sit on my desk and work up to 3 am so that I could not think, dream or even attempt to work on it. Of course, this did not last, days later I checked into the hospital, fatigued, burned out and now I have to deal monthly vitamin refills but what is the use of going through all this instead of admitting that I am dead on the inside???<br>
That is when I realised that pain, loss and heartbreak are an aspect of life that we try so hard to escape but must be felt. The moment I allowed myself to feel each and every emotion in me, I cried in every cosy corner of my house, laughed so hard sometimes at my own jokes, listened to Lana Del Rey so that I could feel everything I had bottled up then I realised holding back was never worth it.
I was happy, sad, angry, excited but most importantly I felt the complexities of my emotions and learnt a lot about myself at that moment.

**Whatever is it, feel it, feel it entirely and understand what it makes you feel like.**

#### LEARNING üìù
I can't believe I just made 2 years of professional work experience this year. What?! I feel like I have worked for the past decade.<br>
My daily tasks heavily depend on learning because for the most part, I work in uncharted waters but what truly motivates me to learn on a daily basis is not only becoming great at my work but also becoming a well rounded person. There are so many aspects of life that require constant practice and taking learning as an incremental process is what has put me in a position of improvement.<br>
Learning daily takes will power, organisation and a high level of planning that most of us never envision. I created a [learning series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm1TIOFMXKDxxZd71edLnWKW0DWuZlPTJ) on my youtube to help breakdown the learning process. This has revolutionalized how I learn new things. Try it out too!

**Never not learn**

#### FAILURE üò¢
Do we recognise failure unless it is sold to us by motivation merchants as redirection?<br>
Failure is nothing close to anything with a negative connotation as it is has been described all my life. In fact, it takes much more courage to admit and embrace failure than to recognise success. Failure is a moment of introspection for you as the executor and your methodology. In that moment, you are your own muse and critique at the same time. Failure is putting a mirror in front of yourself and saying I know it doesn't look like I envisioned and that is okay.<br>
This year I failed so many times at work and on my personal goals but one thing I found hard to do was raising the flag and surrendering. That there is the hardest part of failure.

**Fail often, fail fast**
