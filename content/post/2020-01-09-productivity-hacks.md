*I can't believe I survived the first work week of January…*🥳

As we transition from party December to work January, I am having a hard time getting back to my usual productivity levels. Of course, it takes time and that is why I am writing this article to remind us of how we hacked productivity last year.

I have previously shared my productivity hacks in a youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZiMKbZ8pdc&t=368s).

#### Task lists and reminders 
The secret to having a more productive day is an organized task list. The correlation here lies in how easy it is to execute tasks when you have already listed them up, more like laying out your clothes the night before work. A great task list is comprised of columns of incoming, in progress and done tasks. This eases the movement of tasks across the board as the day progresses and helps measure your daily progress.<br> Reminders come in hand when you have time-bound tasks, don't hesitate to put a reminder prior as this helps you keep on time.<br>
**Pick up that notebook, open that calendar, schedule your tasks.**

#### Turn off notifications
Notifications are designed to trigger us to check our devices immediately they pop up. This is associated with the sound and design of a notification banner. Regardless of what you are working on, notifications will have you stop and first attend to them and when this happens repeatedly you will find yourself paying more attention to the notification source.
<li> **Turn off those notifications, that way you won't be aware of what is popping until you deliberately check.**
<li> **Put that phone away and check on it for 5 minutes every after 30 minutes of working on a task**

#### Doing the work > Being perfect
Perfectionism has its pros and cons, with perfectionism, every piece of work you put out is examined to the dot. For the sake of productivity, this can actually lead you to withhold completed tasks often as you require to re-examine them. In my humble opinion, doing the work matters more for your productivity than perfecting it.<br>
**Do the work first, perfect it later**
<hr>
#### Website blockers
A lot of work requires research across the web thus forcing us to spend lots of time googling and reading through sites, however, this will easily tempt one to access some apps via web versions or your favourite pass time sites.<br>
Website blockers come in hand to help restrict access to a bunch of sites that can potentially become distractive.<br>
**My favourite website blocker is [gofuckingwork](https://gofuckingwork.com/)**

#### Take your nap/break
The secret to productivity is not overworking. Everyone requires a certain amount of rest to keep their brain at the optimal working state. This requires that you periodically take breaks or naps during your scheduled work period especially if you have a desk job. Get up, stretch, have a conversation with a colleague just to take your mind off the work and rejuvenate.

I hope you ease into work much easier and have a productive year all throughout. If you find any of these hacks helpful, go ahead share them with your network.

**🥂Toast to a productive 2020!**
