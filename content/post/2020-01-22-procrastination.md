*An honest conversation with my procrastination "spirit"*

Why does procrastination feel good at the moment but awful in the end? I asked myself this after I almost missed an important deadline last Thursday. I realised that procrastination in my world was rooted much deeper than just the work environment around me or the task at hand. Thus the quest to find answers…<br>

**So, what is procrastination rooted in exactly?**

#### Fear
I have a fear of failure, falling short of deadlines and disappointing someone(I really don't know who). This pushes me to over analyse situations and go in only when I can ascertain that the probability of success is anywhere above 50%.To shield me from this,  procrastination becomes my go-to mechanism. It pushes my fear as far away as possible and buys me more time to over analyse the situation. Crazy! As much as this sounds like an over analysed state of my fears, it holds true when you have not come to terms with yourself on matters of failure and redirection. It takes time.

#### Impostor syndrome
There are so many sides of impostor syndrome. The self-doubt side is triggered when I am faced with tasks that I know I am good at and I start to second guess my abilities often asking myself questions like how did I get here? how did I become this good? and that ripples into creating excuses that could push the task out of my responsibility or as far away from me as possible. This spirals into my workflow and forces me to either forego the task, under deliver (procrastination wins) or delegate it than face the inner voice that says I can't do it. I wish I knew how to tell that annoying voice to go away.

#### Perfectionism
There are two sides of perfectionism and the downside is dissatisfaction. Perfectionism comes along with a lot of self-imposed pressure to produce the finest work at every attempt. The bad news is you can't do this all the time but the good news is you can always do your best and iterate. Looking at tasks as a do or die situation will have me panicking and looking for either a strategy to escape the work or one to wreck myself in panic at the last minute to a deadline. I always choose to wreck myself than live with my mistakes.

#### A way forward
With this introspect, I am fully aware that for me procrastination is much more than disorganized schedules and last-minute work. It is also my attitude and feeling towards the work I am attempting to do. This is pushing me to work on myself internally as I make an effort to continue on a productive path.
