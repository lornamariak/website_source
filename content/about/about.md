I am a data analyst and content creator.
I split my time between building data science projects in and out of work and creating content on this blog and my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/lornamaria).
My content ranges from data science tutorials,productivity hacks and general life topics that interest the present day millenial.

*Interests are data, research on AI and bias, meaningful conversations and cross culture learning.*
