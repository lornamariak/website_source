title: Ease your way into new topics with a learning plan.
type: featured
---

One of my goals for the second half of the year is to help as many people to get a grip on their learning goals for 2019. Throughout my YouTube series Learning with Lorna, I have shared the first step to the learning process, making a learning plan.

#### Key points about a learning plan
* A learning plan is a document that lays out learning prospects over time. When one takes interest in a topic/skill and intends to start learning it, it is important to draft a plan that fits within their schedule to elaborate on how they will pursue this new-found interest. 
* A learning plan is not a timetable.
The plan takes in your learning goals and helps you map out the steps, actions and resources needed to meet them and the evidence that you need to measure success.

##### Section 1
Name: Fill in your name or the name of the person you’re preparing this for.
Date: Fill in the intended learning period e.g 19th June 2019 to 19th July 2019
##### Section 2
This section is a personal introspective centred on helping you discover what you want to meet from this learning process.
Vision: What do you envision yourself achieving by learning this topic/skill?
Expected outcomes: What impact do you want to make by learning this? (centre this on yourself)
##### Section 3
Topics
General topic: Fill in the major topics and break them down into manageable sub-topics, if possible break it down further to fill the sub-specific topics. This will help you have a precise definition of what you’re trying to learn.

##### Learning Aids
In order to maximise your learning goals, you need to take advantage of the resources available to help you learn better. These include tutorials, articles, podcasts, books etc. It is essential for you to map these out ahead of your learning journey and go ahead to insert references to specific resources if you have already found them.
This saves a lot of time when you start your learning process and helps you focus more on learning than trying to find resources.
##### Time frame
Fill in the days and hours you’re dedicating to each sub topic: being specific to the hours will help you know how many hours you cumulatively dedicated to the learning which is a metric of accountability.
##### Place
A great learning environment contributes to the learning process. Depending on what you’re learning and what type of learner you’re, you have to choose your environment carefully and prepare it in advance to avoid distractions and save time.
Find out what type of learner you’re here.
##### Expected Outcomes
For a successful learning process, your goals should be measurable. In the outcomes, set simple actions you can fulfil after each topic learned. These can include taking a quiz, presenting to fellow learners among others. These will cumulatively be a way to measure the success of your learning process.
##### Notes
A space reserved for any comments about the process you have mapped out. You can use it for budgeting your learning process, evaluating how much you need to successfully set aside to buy resources, fund your movements etc. and compare with any available alternatives. The goal is to keep your learning process affordable.
